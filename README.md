# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-a-CNN-and-the-MNIST-dataset
The MNIST dataset, comprising 70,000 grayscale  images of handwritten digits, serves as a benchmark for evalu ating machine learning models. The proposed model utilizes a  sequential architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling  layers, followed by dense layers for classification.
